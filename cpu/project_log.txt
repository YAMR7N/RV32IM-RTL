=== RISC-V Processor + GPIO Integration Project Log ===

STEP 1: Repository Setup and File Collection
• Downloaded RISC-V CPU files from YAMR7N/RV32IM-RTL repository (cpu folder)
• Downloaded additional CPU files from youssef-7atem/ADI-Graduation-Project (RTL branch, cpu folder)
• Successfully merged files - got enhanced version with interconnect capabilities

STEP 2: Fixed Module Compatibility Issues
• Modified InstructionMem.v to use module parameters instead of compiler directives
  - Changed from `ifndef PROGRAM_FILE / `define to parameter PROGRAM_FILE = "program.hex"
  - This allows the interconnect to pass different program files dynamically
• Fixed ALU.v port naming mismatch
  - Changed ALUResultM to ALUResultE to match execute stage expectations
  - Updated internal signal assignments accordingly
• ✅ ARCHITECTURAL INSIGHT: Followed pipeline naming convention
  - F → Fetch stage (PCF, InstrF)
  - D → Decode stage (InstrD, PCPlus4D) 
  - E → Execute stage (ALUResultE, ZeroE)
  - M → Memory stage (ALUResultM, MemWriteM)
  - W → Write back stage (ResultW, RegWriteW)

STEP 3: Memory Interconnect Verification
• Added Address_Decoder.v to top.v includes
• Created simple_test.v testbench (without SystemVerilog assertions for compatibility)
• Successfully compiled and tested basic system
• RESULT: ✅ Memory interconnect working correctly
  - Instruction fetching functional
  - Data memory operations working
  - PC advancement correct
  - ALU operations verified

STEP 4: GPIO Integration Implementation
• Modified memory_interconnect.v for three-way address decoding:
  - IMEM: 0x0000_0000–0x0000_7FFF
  - DMEM: 0x0000_8000–0x0000_FFFF  
  - GPIO: 0x1000_0000–0x1000_00FF
• Added GPIO module instantiation in interconnect with full interface
• Updated top.v module interface to expose GPIO pins and interrupt
• Added gpio.v to includes list

STEP 5: Complete System Verification
• Created gpio_test.v comprehensive testbench
• Successfully compiled and tested complete system
• RESULT: ✅ Full RISC-V + GPIO system working
  - Processor executing instructions correctly
  - Memory operations functional
  - GPIO module integrated and responsive
  - Address decoding working for all three regions
  - No compilation errors or runtime issues

STEP 6: GPIO Program Testing
• Extracted GPIO test instructions from gpio_disassembly.txt
• Created gpio.hex program file with 315 instructions
• Developed gpio_program_test.v testbench for comprehensive GPIO testing
• RESULT: ✅ GPIO Program Execution Complete
  - ✅ gpio.hex loaded and executed successfully
  - ✅ GPIO pins responded to testbench input patterns (0xAAAAAAAA, 0x55555555, 0x12345678)
  - ✅ Bidirectional GPIO operation verified
  - ✅ Memory-mapped GPIO register access functional
  - ✅ VCD waveform files generated (gpio_program_test.vcd - 222KB)

=== FINAL STATUS: ✅ PROJECT COMPLETE ===
